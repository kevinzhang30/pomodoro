# Pomodoro Timer App

This **Pomodoro Timer App** is a simple productivity tool designed to help users focus and study using the Pomodoro Technique. It breaks work into intervals, typically 25 minutes of focused work followed by short breaks, with a longer break after a set of sessions. The app is built using Pythonâ€™s **Tkinter** library to provide a graphical user interface.

## Features
- **Customizable Timer Intervals**: Default intervals are 25 minutes of work, 5-minute short breaks, and 15-minute long breaks.
- **Session Counter**: Tracks the number of completed work sessions.
- **Simple GUI**: A clean, user-friendly interface built with **Tkinter** for starting and stopping the timer.
- **Automatic Transition**: Automatically switches between work and break periods, notifying the user when the session ends.

## Libraries Used
- **Tkinter**: Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the app.
- **Time**: Handles the countdown functionality.

## How to Use
1. **Start a Session**: Run the `main.py` file, and click the "Start" button to begin a 25-minute work session.
2. **Breaks**: After each session, a short break will automatically start. After four work sessions, a long break will begin.
3. **Reset or Exit**: Use the "Reset" button to restart the current session or exit to close the app.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: The main Python script that contains the Pomodoro timer logic.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information on how to set up and use the app.

## Future Enhancements
- Add customizable work and break durations through the user interface.
- Implement notifications or sound alerts when the session ends.
- Add the ability to pause the timer.
